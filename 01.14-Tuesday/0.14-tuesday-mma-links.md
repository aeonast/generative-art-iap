# Local (Mathematica) Notebooks
Execute the following commands in a Mathematica notebook to open a local copy of the notebooks.
You can of-course git clone instead too. 
```mathematica
(*00X_mma-intro.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JzBGZQ57"]
(*01_workshop-introduction*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JywLcv5i"]
(*02_lindenmayer-systems.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JzBOZuoA"]
(*04X_mathematical-fractals*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JywNfBew"]
```
# Wolfram Cloud Notebooks
If you don't have access to a local Mathematica copy, I've published the notebooks on my cloud account - so you can also access them by going to the following links. Fair warning: some of these will run (significantly) slower on the web..
