# Local (Mathematica) Notebooks
Execute the following commands in a Mathematica notebook to open a local copy of the notebooks.
You can of-course git clone instead too. 
```mathematica
(*02_diffusion-limited-aggregation.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JCyjFuFf"]
(*03_reaction-diffusion.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JCO1V39H"]
```
# Wolfram Cloud Notebooks
If you don't have access to a local Mathematica copy, I've published the notebooks on my cloud account - so you can also access them by going to the following links. Similar to Colaboratory, there's a `Make Your Own Copy` button on the top right. Fair warning: some of these will run (significantly) slower on the web..
