# 3.022 Recitations
Hey everyone, I'm covering recitations for Allie this week. 
I was hoping to show some visualizations today, but turns out 13-3101 does not have a projector.
I'll update this page with the room number when I find an available room. 

## 02/11 Recitations
### 11:00 - noon recitation
Room 56-169
### noon- 1pm recitation
Room 66-156

### Addendum Note on ['Stars and Bars'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)):
We're considering a system of `N` harmonic oscillators, each of which can be in an energy level given by:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;E_i&space;=&space;\hbar&space;\omega&space;(n_i&plus;\tfrac{1}{2})" title="E_i = \hbar \omega (n_i+\tfrac{1}{2})" />, where `n_i = {0,1,2,...}` is the occupation number of the i-th oscillator.

The total internal energy is therefore given by:<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?U&space;=&space;\hbar&space;\omega&space;\left(&space;\sum_{i=1}^N&space;n_i&space;&plus;\frac{N}{2}&space;\right&space;)=\hbar&space;\omega&space;\left(&space;M&space;&plus;\frac{N}{2}&space;\right&space;)" title="U = \hbar \omega \left( \sum_{i=1}^N n_i +\frac{N}{2} \right )=\hbar \omega \left( M +\frac{N}{2} \right )" />

where `M` is the sum over individual occupation numbers.
We are interested in calculating the number of different ways the set of occupation numbers `{n_i}` can sum up to M.
This is analogous to asking how many ways one can distribute `M` units of 'energy' in `N` slots, or asking how many ways one can distribute `M` stars using `N-1` bars.
In this framework, the occupation number of the i-th oscillator is given by the number of stars in the i-th 'slot'. 

For example, for `M=6`, `N=3` two possible configurations could be:
```
** | *** | *    =>    n_1=2, n_2=3, n_3=1
* | ***** |     =>    n_1=1, n_2=5, n_3=0
```
