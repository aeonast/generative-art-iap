# Generative Art Workshop (IAP 2020)

This is the repository of the generative art workshop, taught by Jovana Andrejevic, Nina Andrejevic, Amina Matt, and George Varnavides, in IAP 2020.

## Communication
At the risk of overwhelming you with communication, there are three main ways in which we'll communicate with you for this class.
* [Github repository](https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap): To access the notebooks and files used in class
* [generative-art-2020 Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/generative-art-2020/shared_invite/enQtOTA0ODUzNzg4OTk4LWQwODgwYjQ4MzlhNjRlOTk0YjU1NzllYjk1MTZhNzk1N2JkOWI1MzM1ODZmMDkxMzM1YzQwM2JkMTZjYTE5NzE): To communicate with the instructors (and each other) during the class/office-hours
* [generative-art-2020@mit.edu Mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/generative-art-2020): To communicate class-wide announcements

## Programming Languages
While there are many great programming languages to do generative art with, the class will be taught using the Wolfram Language and Python. This choice is partly due to the following reasons (aside from the instructors' familiarity with these languages):
1. The interactive Notebook format compliments the way we prototype and think of generative art
2. Ease of prototyping (and learning) code
3. Built-in (high-level) visualization functions

However, the two do have their differences: Mathematica enables fast prototyping, with many sophisticated, built-in routines. Python will require more hands-on implementation; however, this also allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms.

Note that we'll try and provide *most* of the content in both Mathematica(.nb) and Jupyter(.ipynb) notebooks; while we'll alternate presenting certain concepts in Mathematica and others in Python, you will have the corresponding notebook in the other language for reference. Please plan to bring a laptop to class and install the software beforehand.

### Installation instructions (Wolfram Language)
If you're an MIT student, you can get a free student license for Mathematica following IST's instructions here: https://ist.mit.edu/mathematica/desktop.
If you don't have access to an academic license, you can download the free Wolfram player here: https://www.wolfram.com/player/ (Note you won't be able to edit the code).

### Installation instructions (Python)
We'll use Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to share and run notebooks.
If you already have a local installation of Jupyter, feel free to use that instead.
