# Generative Art Workshop (IAP 2021)
This is the git repository of the generative art workshop, taught by Jovana Andrejevic, Nina Andrejevic, and George Varnavides, in IAP 2021. This is the fourth iteration of the generative art workshop taught over IAP by the instructors (previously taught in 2017 and 2018 with Emma Vargo, and in 2019 with Amina Matt). We are indebted to Emma and Amina for some of the original content we'll use in the workshop.

## Communication

At the risk of overwhelming you with communication, there are three main ways in which we'll communicate with you for this class.
* [Github repository](https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap): To access the notebooks and files used in class
* [generative-art-2020 Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/generative-art-2020/shared_invite/enQtOTA0ODUzNzg4OTk4LWQwODgwYjQ4MzlhNjRlOTk0YjU1NzllYjk1MTZhNzk1N2JkOWI1MzM1ODZmMDkxMzM1YzQwM2JkMTZjYTE5NzE): To communicate with the instructors (and each other) during the class/office-hours
* [generative-art-2020@mit.edu Mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/generative-art-2020): To communicate class-wide announcements

## Programming Languages
While there are many great programming and scripting languages to do generative art with, the class will be taught using Python, the Wolfram Language, and (to a lesser extent) Julia. This choice is partly due to the following reasons (aside from the instructors' familiarity with these languages):
1. Ease of prototyping (and learning) code
2. Built-in (high-level) visualization functions
3. The interactive Notebook format compliments the way we prototype and think of generative art

This last point also motivates the use of Jupyter notebooks in particular. We'll use [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) to share fully-executable notebooks with both Python and Julia kernels. The Wolfram Language has its own notebook interface, which we'll be using via the Wolfram cloud. If you prefer to have all the notebooks in one place, you can clone the repository locally and [connect the Wolfram Language kernel with a local Jupyter installation](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter).

Note that we'll try and provide *most* of the content in both Mathematica(.nb) and Jupyter(.ipynb) notebooks; while we'll alternate presenting certain concepts in Mathematica and others in Python and Julia, you will have the corresponding notebook in the other language for reference.

### Installation instructions (Wolfram Language)
If you're an MIT student, you can get a free student license for Mathematica following IST's instructions here: https://ist.mit.edu/mathematica/desktop.
If you don't have access to an academic license, you can download the free Wolfram player here: https://www.wolfram.com/player/ (Note you won't be able to edit the code).

### Installation instructions (Python)
We'll be using Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to run Jupyter notebooks in Python. Google Colab is a cloud-based, free Jupyter notebook environment, and the notebooks can be downloaded if you prefer to run with a local Jupyter installation. All you need to use Google Colab is a Google account.
