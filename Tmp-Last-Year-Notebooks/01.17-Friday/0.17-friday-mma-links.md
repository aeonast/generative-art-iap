# Local (Mathematica) Notebooks
Execute the following commands in a Mathematica notebook to open a local copy of the notebooks.
You can of-course git clone instead too. 
```mathematica
(*01_audio-lindenmayer-systems.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JE9uMQiE"]
(*02_a-choir-dla.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JEfHPofC"]
(*03_Gyroid _ 3D_Printing.nb*)
NotebookOpen["https://wolfr.am/JEfsejsh"]
```
# Wolfram Cloud Notebooks
If you don't have access to a local Mathematica copy, I've published the notebooks on my cloud account - so you can also access them by going to the following links. Similar to Colaboratory, there's a `Make Your Own Copy` button on the top right. Fair warning: some of these will run (significantly) slower on the web..
